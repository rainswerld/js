They've been using `var` throughout the pre-work. We should explain let and
const:

This looks like a nice explanation of using let and const and likely not using var in ES6: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75

They've also been using `;`s:
Semicolons are a toss up.
Google style guide says they're required: https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html
jshttp github repo style guide says not required and don't worry about arguing about it: https://github.com/jshttp/style-guide

I think the most important thing is consistency and not going against the grain when working in your team at your future job. It's not wrong to use things previously made popular (var and semicolons), but here at SEI we teach the latest standards and recommendations. That being said, when you're browsing the internet for answers and reading source code, you will definitely see older syntax, and you'll have to just learn how to read it and convert it to your personal style.

### Pemdas Diagram
Talking about PEMDAS before talking about operator precedence can be beneficial.  Since developers should be familiar with precedence already from math classes.

## Extra Challenge
We typically have a small handful of devs that need an extra challenge to fill workshop time on the first day of JS. The  [JavaScript Koans Challenge](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/benjenkinsga/a11617635e1dbcfcf3dc45fcb0aa50a7) is an option, its challenging and doesn't use our style guide but it should definitely keep them busy for the rest of the day as well as introduce lots of testing concepts which can be extremely valuable.
